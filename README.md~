==========

Logo idea - https://www.geeksquad.com/

Potential design for admin panel:
	http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frito-lay-showcase.jpg?zoom=1.5&resize=1025%2C918
	http://wptavern.com/frito-lays-custom-project-management-app-is-built-on-wordpress
Maybe use TwentyFifteen layout, with wp-admin menu in sidebar when editing.


Instead of charging, give free comics to those who tweet or FB about the last comic they read. Each comic = 1 tweet/FB message.


Comic GLot

Suitable comic to port into it:
http://www.sandraandwoo.com/gaiade/2014/12/19/alle-schranken-fallen-030/
https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/comics/digital.php - multiple languages
http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=57775 - Public domain coz old? Saw some comment as such on the site.


Potential names:
polyhumorous

Ideas:
1. My assignment for students to translate, then have language school review. School gets free access in return.
2. After each page, users select from five potential plot lines to check if they understood. Rated accordingly.
3. Email signup. Newsletter.
