Comic Jet
=========

leveldb - useful for offline DB access ... https://github.com/google/leveldb. Suggested by Alexander.

Potential design for admin panel:
	http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/frito-lay-showcase.jpg?zoom=1.5&resize=1025%2C918
	http://wptavern.com/frito-lays-custom-project-management-app-is-built-on-wordpress
Maybe use TwentyFifteen layout, with wp-admin menu in sidebar when editing.


Instead of charging, give free comics to those who tweet or FB about the last comic they read. Each comic = 1 tweet/FB message.


When logged in, should store exact last page user was on. Then when they revisit that comic, it should return to that page. Store in Redis with key of "slug-pagenumber", then the value of the page number they were on.


Encourage translators, but giving prominent credit and link back. Could show picture of them with info. before or after reading comic.


Comic GLot

Suitable comic to port into it:
Available in German ... http://mimiandeunice.com/about/
http://www.sandraandwoo.com/gaiade/2014/12/19/alle-schranken-fallen-030/
https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/comics/digital.php - multiple languages
http://comicbookplus.com/?dlid=57775 - Public domain coz old? Saw some comment as such on the site.
http://www.itchyfeetcomic.com/ - may not allow for translations - ask



Ideas:
1. My assignment for students to translate, then have language school review. School gets free access in return.
2. After each page, users select from five potential plot lines to check if they understood. Rated accordingly.
3. Email signup. Newsletter. Powered via blog.
4. blog.comicjet.com
	Weekly list of new comics and news.
